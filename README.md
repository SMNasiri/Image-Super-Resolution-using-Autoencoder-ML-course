# Image-Super-Resolution-using-Autoencoder-ML-course
Image Super Resolution using Autoencoder implemented in PyTorch, enhancing the resolution of images from a low-resolution input to high-resolution output. This project includes training on a specialized dataset, visualizing reconstructed outputs, and evaluating performance with learning curves and sample comparisons.
